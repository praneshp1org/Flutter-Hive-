# Hive Demo

This is a demo **Flutter** project using [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) as the persistent local database.

The app consists of three screens:

1. **InfoScreen:** for showing the person information that is present in Hive database, and a button for deleting a specific person data.
2. **AddScreen:** for storing the information of a person on the database.
3. **UpdateScreen:** for updating the information of a person on the database.
